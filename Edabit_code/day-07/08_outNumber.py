a = '''I am Md.Dulal Miah. This time I am studying at University. I love math and programming. My friend suggested me. You can try as a data analyst. I searched data analyst course. One day, I found this course. 
But I can not buy this course. Because I earned very poor. So, I am applying for Financial Aid. I work as a private tutor. I teach math, chemistry, physics. As a student, I can't bear the tuition fee of my university. I get a waiver from my university.
 My father died in 1999. My mother is working in a garments factory. Her income was used for food, medicine, etc. My income is used for tuition fees. At last, we had no money. so, I can't pay for this course.
If you guys will help for access this course, I will try my best. In this time, I learned python, SQL, Excel for data analysis.'''
